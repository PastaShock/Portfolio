# React Portfolio Blog
### A blog formatted andd created from a tempalte I used for my portfolio
This project is an extension of my portfolio. I started there and reworked it as a way to re-learn react and to deploy a working blog.

### Goals for This Project
I intend to build a modular blog with elements that are frequently reused as data is pulled in.
The blog should be available on ssl on a subdomain of my portfolio
The data should live in a database and images on a cdn or s3 bucket
- It needs to be matched to a database app
- it neets a way to be lined to a repository
I would like the main page to show blog posts on pages (10 posts/page)
I would like a blog post creator page
- It should have an image uploader that uploads an image to the repository
    - it should rename the image with the title of the blog (blog-post-title-header.img)
- it should have basic formatting (BBcode or markdown)
- it should allow inline images
- it should have different post types (text, gallery, video/media)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

runs the app in production mode on port 443. Uses SSL certificates and should really only work on the production server.
I could also run the app once its been built with nginx or apache

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
